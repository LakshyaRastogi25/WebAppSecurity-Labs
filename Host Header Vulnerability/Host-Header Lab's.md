**Lab: Basic password reset poisoning
Meaning of poisoning here is :-**
Manipulating the Host header in the HTTP request to trick the application into generating a password reset link that points to an attacker-controlled domain or server (the attacker's exploit server).

1.Request a password reset for your own account

Go to the login page and click on the "Forgot your password?" link.

Enter your username and request a password reset.

2.Check the email

Go to the exploit server and open the email client.

Observe that you’ve received an email containing a password reset link with a query parameter temp-forgot-password-token.

3.Reset your password

Click on the link in the email, enter a new password, and reset it successfully.

4.Inspect the HTTP request

In Burp, check the HTTP history for the POST /forgot-password request that triggered the password reset email.

Notice that the username is included in the body parameter.

Send this request to Burp Repeater.

5.Test the Host header

In Burp Repeater, modify the Host header to an arbitrary value (e.g., test.com) and send the request.

Go back to the exploit server's email client, and you will receive a new email with the Host header value reflected in the password reset link.

6.Set up the exploit

In Burp Repeater, change the Host header to your exploit server's domain (e.g., YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net).

Change the username parameter in the body to carlos.

Send the request.

7.Capture Carlos’s password reset token

Go to your exploit server and open the access log.

Look for a GET /forgot-password request containing the temp-forgot-password-token parameter.

Copy Carlos’s password reset token.

8.Use the genuine password reset URL

Go to your email client and copy the genuine password reset URL from your first email.

Open this URL in the browser but replace the temp-forgot-password-token parameter with Carlos’s token from the access log.

9.Change Carlos’s password

On the password reset page, set a new password for Carlos’s account.

10.Log in as Carlos

Log in to Carlos’s account using the new password.

The lab will be solved.
