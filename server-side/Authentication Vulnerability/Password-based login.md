**Vulnerabilities in password-based login**

*)**Bruteforcing** :- 1) Bruteforcing passwords
2) Bruteforcing Usernames

*)**Username enumeration**

Key Difference

**Username enumeration** is more about identifying valid usernames through clues given by the application, often passively or with minimal attempts.

**Brute-forcing usernames** is a more active approach, making repeated attempts to uncover valid usernames, which can be noisy and may trigger security alerts on the system.

**Username enumeration via different responses**

Meaning of "different response" :-
Systems often give slightly different responses based on whether the username exists, which attackers can exploit. Here’s how different responses can reveal information:

1)**Error Message Differences**:
Some applications display specific error messages based on whether the username or password is incorrect.

2)**Response Timing**:
If an application takes noticeably different times to respond based on the validity of the username, an attacker can infer valid usernames by measuring response times.

3)**HTTP Status Codes**:
Some applications return different HTTP status codes for valid and invalid usernames.

4)**Account Lock Messages**:
Some systems lock accounts after multiple failed login attempts and display an "Account locked" message.
If this message appears after repeated login attempts with a valid username, it can reveal that the username exists.

5)**Forgot Password Functionality**:
Many applications have a "Forgot Password" feature where entering an email or username triggers different responses based on validity.

1) Open Burp Suite: Launch Burp Suite and turn off the "Intercept" feature. This will speed up the process, allowing requests to pass through without interruption.

2) Login with Test Credentials: On the web application, attempt to log in with any credentials. This action generates a POST request for the login attempt, which Burp will capture.

3) Capture the Request:
->Go to the HTTP History tab in Burp Suite.
->Locate the POST request that contains your login credentials and send it to Intruder.

5) Set Up Intruder Attack:
->In Intruder, highlight the username parameter to mark it as a payload position.
->Choose Sniper as the attack type since we are brute-forcing a single parameter.

5) Configure Payload for Usernames:
->Go to the Payloads tab and select Payload Set 1.
->Choose Simple List as the payload type.
->Paste in the username list provided to you.

6) Launch the Attack:
->Start the attack by clicking Start Attack.
->After the attack finishes, look for a username with a different response length (e.g., "app1" with a length of 3104).

7) Brute-Force Password:
->Back in Intruder, enter the identified username ("app1").
->Mark the password parameter as a payload position, then replace the list with the provided password list.

8) Start Password Attack:
->Start the attack again.
->Review the results to find a password with a different response length (e.g., "harley").

**Username enumeration via subtly different responses**

1)Set Up Burp Suite:
->Open Burp Suite, configure your browser to route traffic through Burp, and disable Intercept to streamline the process.

2)Login Attempt:
->Attempt to log in to the application with any credentials.
->You should receive an "Invalid username or password" message. Capture this POST request in Burp’s HTTP History and send it to Intruder.

3)Configure Intruder:
->In Intruder, select the username parameter in the Positions tab and set the attack type to Sniper.
->In the Payloads tab, paste in the username wordlist.

4)Set Up Grep Extraction:
->Go to the Options tab and scroll down to the Grep - Extract section.
->Click Add and select the response text "Invalid username or password" to track.

5)Run the Username Attack:
->Start the attack. In the Warning column, you will see a payload with a response that differs from the others (e.g., a missing full stop in "Invalid username or password").
->Note the unique username identified (e.g., "adkit").

6)Brute-Force Password:
->Back in Intruder, enter the discovered username ("adkit").
->Add the password parameter as a new position, and paste in the password wordlist.
->This time, you can skip the Grep - Extract step.

7)Run the Password Attack:
->Start the attack and monitor the status codes. Look for a payload with a 302 status code (indicating a redirect).
->The username and password combination associated with this response allows you to log into the application.
