**Server-Side Vulnerabilities**

Server-side vulnerabilities exist in the back-end of a web application—the part that runs on the server and handles requests, databases, file storage, and processing. When a vulnerability exists on the server side, it can often impact the entire system or compromise sensitive data.

Characteristics of Server-Side Vulnerabilities:

Access and Control: They can lead to unauthorized access, control over server resources, or manipulation of data.
Impact: The effects are often broader because they involve the core server infrastructure, impacting data and multiple users.
Examples:

SQL Injection: Manipulating SQL queries to access or alter data in a database.
Authentication Vulnerabilities: Weaknesses in login systems that allow unauthorized access.
Path Traversal: Accessing files or directories on the server that should be restricted.
Command Injection: Injecting commands into an application’s code that the server then executes.
Business Logic Vulnerabilities: Exploiting flaws in the business rules or workflow.
Information Disclosure: Leaking sensitive information like server details, paths, or error messages.
Access Control Issues: Bypassing security checks and accessing restricted content.
File Upload Vulnerabilities: Uploading malicious files that execute on the server.
