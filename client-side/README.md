**Client-Side Vulnerabilities**

Client-side vulnerabilities occur in the front-end—the part of the application that runs in the user’s browser. These vulnerabilities affect how the web application interacts with users and how code executes in the browser environment.

Characteristics of Client-Side Vulnerabilities:

Impact on User Experience: Often impacts the individual user interacting with the application rather than the server directly.
User-Focused Attacks: Attackers can manipulate what the user sees or the actions they perform on the front end.
Examples:

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Injecting malicious scripts into webpages, which then run in other users’ browsers.
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Forcing a user to perform actions on a web app without their consent.
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Vulnerabilities: Exploiting browser policies that control requests between different sites.
DOM-Based Vulnerabilities: Manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) in a way that leads to security issues.
Web Socket Vulnerabilities: Intercepting or manipulating real-time communications in the browser.
