Other mechanisms include -
1. Reset password functionality :- 
a) forgot password
b) change password
2. Remember me functionality.
3. Lock out mechanism.
Lab Write-Up: Password brute-force via password change
Step 1: Initial Setup
Configure Burp Suite and ensure your browser is properly set up to route traffic through the proxy.
Access the lab and log in using the provided credentials.
Step 2: Observing the Password Change Functionality
Navigate to the "Change Password" feature on the application.
Note that the form requires three fields:
Current Password
New Password
Confirm New Password
Perform the following observations:
When you submit an incorrect Current Password with matching New Password and Confirm New Password, the account gets blocked after multiple attempts.
When you provide the correct Current Password but different values for New Password and Confirm New Password, the application throws an error message: "New passwords don’t match."
Step 3: Exploiting the Functionality
Recognize that the error message for mismatched new passwords can help identify the correct Current Password.
Use Burp Suite to capture the POST request for changing the password:
Send the request to the Intruder tool.
Modify the username parameter to target the victim username carlos.
Set the current-password parameter as the payload position.
Step 4: Configuring the Intruder Attack
In Payloads, upload a wordlist of potential passwords for the current-password parameter.
In Grep – Match settings:
Add the string "New passwords don’t match" to identify successful guesses.
Start the attack.
Step 5: Analyzing the Results
Observe the responses in the attack results. Under the "New passwords don’t match" column, look for the payload that triggers this message.
Identify the correct password for carlos (in this case, 123456).
Step 6: Logging In
Use the identified password (123456) to log in as carlos.
Successfully solve the lab!
Key Takeaways
This attack leverages a logic flaw in the password change functionality, allowing brute force attempts without account lockout.
The error messages provide unintended feedback, aiding in identifying valid credentials.
Always validate and handle error messages securely to prevent information disclosure.
