**Two-factor authentication** (2FA) is based on something you know and something you have. This usually requires users to enter both a traditional password and a temporary verification code from an out-of-band physical device in their possession.
What are **Authentication Tokens**?
Authentication tokens are digital or physical mechanisms used to prove a user's identity and grant them access to systems or applications. They are often used as part of MFA (e.g., the "something you have" factor).
Examples of Authentication Tokens are :-
a) One-Time password (OTP)
b) Json Web Token (JWT)
c) Physical Tokens (key fob)

**LAB:1**
**Lab: 2FA simple bypass**
**AIM**- This lab's two-factor authentication can be bypassed. To solve the lab, access Carlos's account page.
**Given Credentials**-
->Your credentials: wiener:peter
->Victim's credentials carlos:montoya
Step 1: Access the Lab and Login with Your Credentials
Action: Log in to the application using the provided credentials.
Observation: After a successful login, the application prompts you to enter a verification code that has been sent to your email.
Submit: Enter the correct verification code from your email to complete the login process.
Step 2: Log Out and Enter Victim Credentials
Action: Log out of your current session.
Victim Login: Enter the victim's credentials (provided in the lab).
Observation: After entering the credentials, you will be prompted to enter a verification code (just like in Step 1).
Step 3: Bypass the MFA
Action: To bypass the MFA, modify the URL by removing the "/login2" parameter.
You will notice that after doing so, the application will redirect you to the home page.
Navigate: Once on the home page, click on the "My Account" section on the left side of the page.
Step 4: Explanation of the Logic Flaw
Analysis: The application has a logic flaw that makes the MFA ineffective in certain scenarios. After submitting the victimâ€™s credentials, the system logically authenticates the user, and the MFA becomes a redundant step.
Conclusion: The two-factor authentication (2FA) in this case is merely a weak barrier that has been misconfigured, allowing attackers to bypass it easily by manipulating the URL.

**LAB:2**
**Lab: 2FA simple bypass**
**AIM**- This lab's two-factor authentication is vulnerable due to its flawed logic. To solve the lab, access Carlos's account page.
**Given Credentials**-
->Your credentials: wiener:peter
->Victim's username: carlos
