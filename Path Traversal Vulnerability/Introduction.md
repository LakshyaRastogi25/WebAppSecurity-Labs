**What is path traversal?**

Path traversal is also known as **dot-dot-slash attack (../)**, directory traversal, directory climbing, or backtracking.
These vulnerabilities enable an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that is running an application. This might include:

-> Application code and data.

-> Credentials for back-end systems.

-> Sensitive operating system files.

In some cases, an attacker might be able to write to arbitrary files on the server, allowing them to modify application data or behavior, and ultimately take full control of the server.

It is important to note that different operating systems use different path separators

**Unix-like OS:**

root directory: /

directory separator: /

**Windows OS:**

root directory: "<drive letter>":

directory separator: \ or /

**Classic macOS:**

root directory: "<drive letter>":

directory separator: :

If an application rejects standard sequence (../,..\) there are many ways to bypass them -:

1) using ....//, ..../\.

2) using Absolute file path like :- /etc/passwd.

3) Use URL encoding or double URL encoding.

4) Using a null byte %00.

**How to prevent a path traversal attack**

The most effective way to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities is to avoid passing user-supplied input to filesystem APIs altogether. 
Many application functions that do this can be rewritten to deliver the same behavior in a safer way.

If you can't avoid passing user-supplied input to filesystem APIs, we recommend using two layers of defense to prevent attacks:

Validate the user input before processing it. Ideally, compare the user input with a whitelist of permitted values. 
If that isn't possible, verify that the input contains only permitted content, such as alphanumeric characters only.

After validating the supplied input, append the input to the base directory and use a platform filesystem API to canonicalize the path. 
Verify that the canonicalized path starts with the expected base directory
