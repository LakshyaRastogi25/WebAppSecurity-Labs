# Web Application Security Labs

Welcome to the **Web Application Security Labs** repository! This project is a collection of detailed write-ups and analyses on various web application vulnerabilities. Each section includes descriptions, exploit techniques, and remediation recommendations for core security vulnerabilities, inspired by OWASP guidelines and practical lab exercises.

## Learning Resources
This repository draws on insights from **The Web Application Hacker's Handbook** and **OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)**, two essential resources for mastering web application security.

## Lab Structure and Approach
The labs in this repository are based on hands-on exercises from **PortSwigger**. The project includes both **server-side vulnerabilities** and **client-side vulnerabilities**. I would prefer starting with server-side vulnerabilities, being it beginner-friendly, foundational topics to build a strong base before moving into more complex, **client-side vulnerabilities**.

## Contents
- NoSQL Injection
- Authentication Vulnerabilities
- Path Traversal
- Command Injection
- Business logic vulnerabilities
- Information Disclosure
- Access Control
- File Upload vulnerabilities
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Web Cache Deception

## Goals
- To demonstrate a hands-on approach to identifying and exploiting web application vulnerabilities.
- To provide remediation techniques and best practices for secure coding.
