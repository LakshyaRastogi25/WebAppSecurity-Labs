# Lab: 1 Stored XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded
## **Write-Up: Stored XSS in Blog Comment Section**  

### **Overview**  
This lab demonstrates a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability** in the blogâ€™s comment functionality. Unlike **Reflected XSS**, which executes immediately, **Stored XSS** persists in the application and affects all users who view the compromised page.  

### **Steps to Exploit**  

1. **Identifying a Potential Injection Point:**  
   - The website has a comment section where users can enter a name, email, website, and a comment.  
   - Since comments are stored and displayed on the blog, I tested for possible XSS injection.  

2. **Injecting a Malicious Script:**  
   - In the comment box, I entered the following payload:  
     ```html
     <script>alert(1)</script>
     ```  
   - I filled in the other required fields (name, email, and website) and clicked **"Post comment"**.  

3. **Triggering the XSS Payload:**  
   - After submitting the comment, I navigated back to the blog post.  
   - The alert box popped up, confirming that my JavaScript payload was executed.  
   - This means that every visitor to the blog post will also execute this script in their browser.
