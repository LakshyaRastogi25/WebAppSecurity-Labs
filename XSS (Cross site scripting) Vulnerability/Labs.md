# Lab:1 Reflected XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded
# **Write-Up: Reflected XSS in Search Functionality**  

### **Overview**  
This lab demonstrates a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the search functionality of a web application. The input is reflected in the response without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject and execute malicious scripts.  

### **Steps to Exploit**  

1. **Testing Input Reflection:**  
   - I entered a simple string `"Heyy"` in the search bar.  
   - The response reflected my input in the HTML page, confirming that user input is returned without encoding.  

2. **Injecting a Basic XSS Payload:**  
   - To verify XSS, I injected the following payload in the search input:  
     ```html
     <script>alert(1)</script>
     ```
   - Upon submitting, the browser executed the JavaScript, displaying an alert box with `1`.  

3. **Confirmation of Vulnerability:**  
   - Since the JavaScript executed successfully, the application is vulnerable to reflected XSS.

# Lab: 2 Stored XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded
## **Write-Up: Stored XSS in Blog Comment Section**  

### **Overview**  
This lab demonstrates a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability** in the blogâ€™s comment functionality. Unlike **Reflected XSS**, which executes immediately, **Stored XSS** persists in the application and affects all users who view the compromised page.  

### **Steps to Exploit**  

1. **Identifying a Potential Injection Point:**  
   - The website has a comment section where users can enter a name, email, website, and a comment.  
   - Since comments are stored and displayed on the blog, I tested for possible XSS injection.  

2. **Injecting a Malicious Script:**  
   - In the comment box, I entered the following payload:  
     ```html
     <script>alert(1)</script>
     ```  
   - I filled in the other required fields (name, email, and website) and clicked **"Post comment"**.  

3. **Triggering the XSS Payload:**  
   - After submitting the comment, I navigated back to the blog post.  
   - The alert box popped up, confirming that my JavaScript payload was executed.  
   - This means that every visitor to the blog post will also execute this script in their browser.
