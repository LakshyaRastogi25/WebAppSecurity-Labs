# Lab:1 Reflected XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded
# **Write-Up: Reflected XSS in Search Functionality**  

### **Overview**  
This lab demonstrates a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the search functionality of a web application. The input is reflected in the response without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject and execute malicious scripts.  

### **Steps to Exploit**  

1. **Testing Input Reflection:**  
   - I entered a simple string `"Heyy"` in the search bar.  
   - The response reflected my input in the HTML page, confirming that user input is returned without encoding.  

2. **Injecting a Basic XSS Payload:**  
   - To verify XSS, I injected the following payload in the search input:  
     ```html
     <script>alert(1)</script>
     ```
   - Upon submitting, the browser executed the JavaScript, displaying an alert box with `1`.  

3. **Confirmation of Vulnerability:**  
   - Since the JavaScript executed successfully, the application is vulnerable to reflected XSS.
