# Lab:1 Reflected XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded
# **Write-Up: Reflected XSS in Search Functionality**  

### **Overview**  
This lab demonstrates a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the search functionality of a web application. The input is reflected in the response without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject and execute malicious scripts.  

### **Steps to Exploit**  

1. **Testing Input Reflection:**  
   - I entered a simple string `"Heyy"` in the search bar.  
   - The response reflected my input in the HTML page, confirming that user input is returned without encoding.  

2. **Injecting a Basic XSS Payload:**  
   - To verify XSS, I injected the following payload in the search input:  
     ```html
     <script>alert(1)</script>
     ```
   - Upon submitting, the browser executed the JavaScript, displaying an alert box with `1`.  

3. **Confirmation of Vulnerability:**  
   - Since the JavaScript executed successfully, the application is vulnerable to reflected XSS.

# Lab 2: 
# **Exploiting XSS Through Burp Intruder**

## **Step 1: Testing for Initial XSS Filtering**
To begin, we attempted to inject a standard XSS vector:  

```html
<img src=1 onerror=print()>
```
However, this payload was **blocked** by the application’s filtering mechanisms. Since our initial attempt failed, we need to **analyze which tags and attributes are allowed** by the application.  

---

## **Step 2: Identifying Allowed HTML Tags Using Burp Intruder**
1. **Open Burp's browser** and use the search function in the lab.  
2. **Send the resulting request to Burp Intruder** for further testing.  
3. In **Burp Intruder**, replace the value of the search term with:  

   ```html
   <>
   ```
4. Place the cursor **between the angle brackets** and click **Add §** to create a payload position.  
   - The value should now look like:  
     ```html
     <§§>
     ```
5. **Visit the XSS cheat sheet** and click **Copy tags to clipboard**.  
6. In the **Payloads** panel, under **Payload configuration**, click **Paste** to insert the list of tags into the payload list.  
7. Click **Start attack** to test which tags are allowed.  


---

## **Step 3: Injecting Attributes Into `<body>`**
Since `<body>` is allowed, we now need to determine **which attributes are accepted**.

1. **Modify the Burp Intruder search term** and replace it with:  

   ```html
   <body%20=1>
   ```
2. **Place the cursor before the `=` character** and click **Add §** to create a payload position.  
   - The value should now look like:  
     ```html
     <body%20§§=1>
     ```
3. **Visit the XSS cheat sheet** and click **Copy events to clipboard**.  
4. In the **Payloads** panel, click **Clear** to remove previous payloads.  
5. Click **Paste** to insert the **list of attributes** into the payloads list.  
6. Click **Start attack** to test which event handlers are allowed.  

---

## **Step 4: Delivering the Exploit**
Now that we know the **`onresize` attribute works**, we will craft a final payload to **execute JavaScript on the victim's browser**.  

1. Go to the **exploit server** and paste the following payload:  

   ```html
   <iframe src="https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/?search=%22%3E%3Cbody%20onresize=print()%3E" onload=this.style.width='100px'>
   ```
2. Replace **`YOUR-LAB-ID`** with the actual **Lab ID** for your target.  
3. Click **Store** and then **Deliver exploit to victim**.  

# Lab: 3 Reflected XSS with some SVG markup allowed
### **Write-Up: Exploiting XSS Using Burp Intruder**  

---

### **Step 1: Testing for Initial XSS Filtering**  

To begin, we attempted to inject a standard XSS payload:  

```html
<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>
```
However, this payload **was blocked** by the application’s security mechanisms. Since this attempt failed, we need to analyze **which HTML tags and attributes are allowed** using Burp Intruder.  

---

### **Step 2: Identifying Allowed HTML Tags Using Burp Intruder**  

1. **Open Burp's browser** and use the search function in the lab.  
2. **Send the resulting request to Burp Intruder** for further testing.  
3. In the **request template**, replace the value of the search term with:  

   ```html
   <>
   ```
4. **Place the cursor between the angle brackets (`<>`)** and click **Add §** to create a payload position.  
   - The value should now be:  
     ```html
     <§§>
     ```
5. **Visit the XSS cheat sheet** and click **Copy tags to clipboard**.  
6. In **Burp Intruder**, in the **Payloads** side panel, click **Paste** to insert the list of tags into the payloads list.  
7. Click **Start attack** to test which tags are allowed.  

### **Results Analysis:**  
- Most payloads caused a **400 Bad Request** response, meaning they were blocked.  
- However, the following **tags resulted in a 200 OK response** (indicating they were allowed):  
  - `<svg>`  
  - `<animatetransform>`  
  - `<title>`  
  - `<image>`  

Since `<svg>` and `<animatetransform>` were not blocked, we can attempt further exploitation using them.  

---

### **Step 3: Injecting Attributes Into `<animatetransform>`**  

Since `<animatetransform>` is allowed, we now need to determine **which attributes can execute JavaScript**.

1. **Modify the Burp Intruder search term** and replace it with:  

   ```html
   <svg><animatetransform%20=1>
   ```
2. **Place the cursor before the `=` character** and click **Add §** to create a payload position.  
   - The value should now be:  
     ```html
     <svg><animatetransform%20§§=1>
     ```
3. **Visit the XSS cheat sheet** and click **Copy events to clipboard**.  
4. In **Burp Intruder**, in the **Payloads** side panel, click **Clear** to remove previous payloads.  
5. Click **Paste** to insert the **list of attributes** into the payloads list.  
6. Click **Start attack** to test which event handlers are allowed.  

### **Results Analysis:**  
- Most attributes caused a **400 response**, meaning they were blocked.  
- However, the **`onbegin` attribute** resulted in a **200 OK** response, meaning it was accepted.  

This means we can execute JavaScript using:  

```html
<svg><animatetransform onbegin=alert(1)>
```

---

### **Step 4: Delivering the Exploit**  

Now that we know the **`onbegin` attribute works**, we will craft a final payload to **execute JavaScript when the animation starts**.  

1. **Visit the following URL in the browser** to confirm that `alert(1)` is executed:  

   ```html
   https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/?search=%22%3E%3Csvg%3E%3Canimatetransform%20onbegin=alert(1)%3E
   ```
2. Replace **`YOUR-LAB-ID`** with the actual **Lab ID** for your target.  
3. When the page loads, the **onbegin event will trigger `alert(1)`**, confirming a successful XSS exploit.  

---

### **How Encoding Works:**
You noticed that our payload:  

```html
<svg><animatetransform onbegin=alert(1)>
```
was **encoded into**:  

```
%22%3E%3Csvg%3E%3Canimatetransform%20onbegin=alert(1)%3E
```

Let’s break this down:  

| **Character** | **Original** | **Encoded (URL Encoding)** |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| `"`          | `"`         | `%22`                     |
| `>`          | `>`         | `%3E`                     |
| `<`          | `<`         | `%3C`                     |
| `space`      | ` `         | `%20`                     |

**Explanation:**  
- The `"` (`%22`) at the start is used to **break out of an attribute value** if the application is injecting our input inside an attribute.  
- The `>` (`%3E`) ensures we **close any existing HTML tag** and start our `<svg>` tag.  
- `<svg>` and `<animatetransform>` execute normally after decoding.  
- `%20` is just the encoded space between `animatetransform` and `onbegin`.

# **Lab Write-Up: XSS in HTML Tag Attributes**  

### **Step 1: Identify the Vulnerability**  
- The lab's **search blog functionality** is vulnerable to **reflected XSS**.  
- **Angle brackets (`< >`) are encoded**, meaning we **cannot inject `<script>` tags** directly.  
- Our goal is to **inject an attribute** that triggers JavaScript execution.  

---

### **Step 2: Crafting the Payload**  
Since `<script>` tags are blocked, we use an **event handler** inside an HTML attribute.  

**Final Payload:**  
```html
" autofocus onfocus=alert(document.domain) x="
```

### **Why This Works?**  
- `"` → Closes the existing attribute.  
- `autofocus` → Automatically focuses on the element.  
- `onfocus=alert(document.domain)` → Triggers an alert when the element is focused.  
- `x="` → Prevents breaking the HTML structure.  

---

### **Step 3: Injecting the Payload**  
1. **Go to the search function of the blog.**  
2. **Enter the payload** in the search bar.  
3. **Submit the search query.**  

---

### **Step 4: Observing Execution**  
- The search field **automatically gains focus**, triggering the `onfocus` event.  
- The **alert box appears**, confirming **successful XSS execution**.  

---

### **Step 5: Lab Completion**  
- The JavaScript executed successfully.  
- The **lab is now solved!**
