**NoSQL** or **"Not Only SQL"**, is a **non-relational**, modern database.
It doesnt store data in the form of tables (rows and columns) unlike traditional databases; Hence it is schema-less db.
Popular NoSQL DB includes :-
 - Document-Based → MongoDB, CouchDB (Store JSON-like documents)
 - Key-Value Stores → Redis, DynamoDB (Use key-value pairs)
 - Column-Family Stores → Cassandra, HBase (Optimized for large-scale data storage)
 - Graph-Based → Neo4j (Stores relationships between entities)

**What is NoSQL injection?**

**NoSQL injection** is a vulnerability where an attacker is able to interfere with the queries that an application makes to a NoSQL database. NoSQL injection may enable an attacker to:
 - Bypass authentication or protection mechanisms.
  - Many NoSQL databases are configured with default or no authentication.
  - Lack of role-based access control (RBAC) can expose sensitive data.
 - Extract or edit data.
 - Cause a denial of service.
   - Attackers can craft queries that consume excessive memory or CPU, causing service disruptions.
   - Example: Passing large payloads in MongoDB $where queries can lead to performance issues.
 - Execute code on the server.

**EXAMPLE :**
```
db.users.find({ username: userInput }); // If userInput is `{ "$ne": null }`, it bypasses auth!
```
