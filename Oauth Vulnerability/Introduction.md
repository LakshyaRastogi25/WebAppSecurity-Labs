**What is OAuth?**

OAuth is a commonly used authorization framework that enables websites and web applications to request limited access to a user's account on another application. Crucially, OAuth allows the user to grant this access without exposing their login credentials to the requesting application. This means users can fine-tune which data they want to share rather than having to hand over full control of their account to a third party.

The basic OAuth process is widely used to integrate third-party functionality that requires access to certain data from a user's account. For example, an application might use OAuth to request access to your email contacts list so that it can suggest people to connect with. However, the same mechanism is also used to provide third-party authentication services, allowing users to log in with an account that they have with a different website.

**Main Components** :-

1. Client application - The website or web application that wants to access the user's data.

2. Resource owner - The user whose data the client application wants to access.

3. OAuth service provider - The website or application that controls the user's data and access to it. They support OAuth by providing an API for interacting with both an authorization server and a resource server.

**OAuth grant types :-**

**a) Implicit Flow**-

**Purpose**: Designed for single-page applications (SPAs) where the client (browser) cannot securely store a client secret.

**Process**: The user logs in and grants authorization.

The access token is directly returned to the browser via the redirect URI.

**Key Points**: No authorization code step.

Tokens are exposed in the browser URL fragment (less secure).

No refresh tokens (tokens expire quickly to minimize risk)

**b) Authorization Code Flow**

**Purpose:** Used for server-side applications that can securely store a client secret.

**Process:** The user logs in and grants authorization.

The authorization server issues an authorization code to the client.

The client exchanges the authorization code for an access token (and optionally a refresh token) by authenticating itself with the client secret.

**Key Points:** More secure: Tokens are not exposed to the browser.

Requires an extra step (code exchange).

**c) Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)**

*)PKCE is an extension of the Authorization Code Flow, designed to prevent authorization code interception attacks.

*)It is particularly useful for public clients (e.g., mobile apps, SPAs) that cannot store a client secret securely.

**Major components of grant types** - 

**client_id**

Mandatory parameter containing the unique identifier of the client application. This value is generated when the client application registers with the OAuth service.

**redirect_uri**

The URI to which the user's browser should be redirected when sending the authorization code to the client application. This is also known as the "callback URI" or "callback endpoint". Many OAuth attacks are based on exploiting flaws in the validation of this parameter.

**response_type**

Determines which kind of response the client application is expecting and, therefore, which flow it wants to initiate. For the authorization code grant type, the value should be code.

**scope**

Used to specify which subset of the user's data the client application wants to access. Note that these may be custom scopes set by the OAuth provider or standardized scopes defined by the OpenID Connect specification. We'll cover OpenID Connect in more detail later.

**state**

Stores a unique, unguessable value that is tied to the current session on the client application. The OAuth service should return this exact value in the response, along with the authorization code. This parameter serves as a form of CSRF token for the client application by making sure that the request to its /callback endpoint is from the same person who initiated the OAuth flow.
