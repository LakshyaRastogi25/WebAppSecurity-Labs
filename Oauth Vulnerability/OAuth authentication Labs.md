**Lab 1: Authentication bypass via OAuth implicit flow**

**AIM** - To solve the lab, log in to Carlos's account. His email address is carlos@carlos-montoya.net

**Given Credentials** - wiener:peter

**Step 1: Configure Burp Suite and Log in**

Open Burp Suite and configure it to intercept traffic between your browser and the target application.

Log in to the application using the provided credentials to initiate the OAuth login process.

**Step 2: Complete the OAuth Login Process**

Proceed with the OAuth authentication flow as instructed.

Upon successful authentication, you will be redirected back to the main blog website.

**Step 3: Analyze HTTP History for the OAuth Login**

In Burp Suite, navigate to the HTTP history tab.

Locate the POST request where the OAuth login is completed.

Look for the Set-Cookie header in the response, as it contains the session cookie generated for the logged-in user.

**Step 4: Exploit the Misconfiguration**

From the given victim details, change the username to carlos and update the email to match the victim's email address in the captured POST request.

Copy the session cookie associated with the victim's account.

**Step 5: Log in Using the Victim’s Session Cookie**

Open your browser and use developer tools (e.g., in Chrome: Application > Storage > Cookies) to replace your current session cookie with the victim’s session cookie.

**Notes**
This lab demonstrates how insecure handling of OAuth tokens and cookies can lead to account hijacking.

Always validate and securely handle session tokens to prevent such vulnerabilities.
