### Introduction to File Upload Vulnerability  

File upload vulnerability is a critical security flaw that arises when a web application allows users to upload files without properly validating and restricting them. Attackers can exploit this weakness to upload malicious files, leading to various security threats such as remote code execution, cross-site scripting (XSS), or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.  

### How It Works  

Many web applications provide file upload functionality for profile pictures, documents, or media files. If the application does not enforce strict validation, an attacker can upload files with harmful content, such as:  
1. **Malicious scripts** – Executable files (PHP, ASPX, etc.) that allow attackers to gain control of the server.  
2. **Malware** – Trojan horses or viruses that infect user systems.  
3. **JavaScript payloads** – Scripts that execute in the victim’s browser, leading to XSS attacks.  

### Common Exploitation Techniques  

1. **Bypassing File Type Restrictions** – Attackers rename malicious files with allowed extensions (e.g., `shell.php.jpg`) to deceive weak validation mechanisms.  
2. **MIME Type Tampering** – Changing the file’s MIME type in HTTP requests to bypass content filtering.  
3. **Path Traversal** – Exploiting directory traversal to upload files outside the intended directory and execute them.  
4. **Race Conditions** – Overwriting legitimate files with malicious ones before security checks complete.  

### Impact  

If an attacker successfully uploads and executes a malicious file, they can:  
- Gain unauthorized access to the server.  
- Modify or delete sensitive data.  
- Deploy backdoors for persistent access.  
- Exploit other vulnerabilities within the application.  

### Mitigation Strategies  

To prevent file upload vulnerabilities, applications should implement strict security measures, including:  
- **Allow-listing extensions** – Only permitting specific file types like `.jpg`, `.png`, and `.pdf`.  
- **Server-side validation** – Checking the file type, size, and contents after upload.  
- **Storing files securely** – Placing uploaded files in non-executable directories to prevent execution.  
- **Renaming files** – Assigning random names to uploaded files to prevent direct access.  
- **Using Content Security Policy (CSP)** – Mitigating XSS risks from uploaded files.
